# Nihongo Flash üéå

A modern, responsive Japanese vocabulary flashcard web app designed for effective learning through a simplified Spaced Repetition System (SRS). This application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean user interface and a focused study experience.

-   **Intelligent Spaced Repetition (SRS):** Words you find "Easy" appear less frequently, while words marked as "Hard" are prioritized, optimizing your study time. Your progress is automatically saved.
-   **Daily Study Sessions:** To prevent burnout, the app automatically creates a focused study list (defaulting to 200 words) each day, ensuring you review the most important vocabulary without feeling overwhelmed.
-   **Unlimited "Hard Words" List:** A dedicated, scrollable section to review all the words you have struggled with, accessible at any time via a bookmark icon.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The user interface seamlessly adapts to any device, from desktops to tablets and all modern smartphones (iPhone, Samsung, etc.).
-   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, "frosted glass" design with a dynamic animated background and satisfying, interactive buttons with hover and click effects.
-   **No Dependencies:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries, frameworks, or installations are needed. Just open the `index.html` file to run.
-   **Persistent Progress:** All your learning progress and your "Hard Words" list are automatically saved in your browser's local storage.
